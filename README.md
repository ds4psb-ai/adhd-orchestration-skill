# ADHD Orchestration Skill for Claude Code

A multi-terminal orchestration system that turns scattered parallel work into structured, convergent execution. The core idea: **the agent writing code never judges its own work.** A blind evaluator does. And it runs until the evaluator says PASS.

**v2 (2026-03-30):** Enforcement Architecture — Phase Completion Gates, manifest schema contract (10 required fields), per-phase observability (7 JSONL event types), Phase D Quick Mode, sub-skill crash protocol, and run lifecycle management. Derived from analysis of 31 production runs that revealed 0% Phase D execution rate under the original spec.

## Philosophy

This project implements the **Generator↔Evaluator harness pattern** from Anthropic's engineering research:

1. **Generator and Evaluator are separate agents.** The generator writes code. A blind evaluator — running Opus in a fresh context with zero knowledge of the generator's reasoning — judges it. This structural separation is the single biggest lever for quality.

2. **The best verification is one that actually runs.** v1 mandated 2+ blind evaluator rounds, which resulted in 0/31 runs executing Phase D at all. v2 introduces Quick Mode (1 eval round, ~3 min) as the default — because one round that runs beats two rounds that don't. Full Mode (`--thorough`, 2+ rounds) is available for high-stakes convergence.

3. **Debate before implementation.** Every non-trivial change goes through structured debate (TKC or TK) before a single line of code is written. The debate produces a `handoff.json` contract that the execution harness consumes.

4. **Scatter-to-Converge.** ADHD developers build excellent skeletons across parallel sessions but struggle with completion. This system automates the hard parts: deep diagnosis, conflict-free work distribution across N terminals, and git-based convergence verification.

```

### The Chain

Every task follows one path:

```
/adhd diagnose → /tkm partition → /tkc|/tk debate → /ralph implement+eval → /adhd converge
```

Each link produces a structured artifact consumed by the next:
- **TKM** → work package markdown + stream JSON contracts
- **TKC/TK** → `handoff.json` (debate conclusions, target files, acceptance criteria)
- **Ralph** → `notices.md` (completion signals for ADHD convergence)

## Skills

| Skill | What it does | Standalone? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **`/adhd`** | Mothership: diagnose domain health, route to tiers, dispatch work, converge | Yes |
| **`/tkm`** | Decompose problems into N conflict-free parallel work packages | Yes |
| **`/tkc`** | Self-debate via context-isolated subagent with 6-layer debiasing | Yes |
| **`/tk`** | Claude↔Codex cross-model debate (2 rounds, or 3 with `--deep`) | Yes (needs Codex MCP) |
| **`/ralph`** | Execution harness: Generator + Blind Evaluator loop with persistent state | Yes |
| **`/verify-implementation`** | Diff-aware dynamic check registry | Yes |
| **`/checkpoint`** | Session state persistence with SHA-based staleness | Yes |

Every skill passes the **Sovereignty Test**: callable without ADHD context, produces useful output alone, documented I/O contract, dual-mode entry (standalone or ADHD-routed).

## Key Concepts

### Blind Evaluators (Opus)

The evaluator agents run **Claude Opus** in a fresh context. They have:
- Zero knowledge of the generator's reasoning chain
- Read-only access to code + test commands
- A skepticism mandate: "if you find zero issues, double-check"
- Strict output contract: PASS with evidence, or FAIL with file:line gaps

Three evaluator variants:
- `blind-evaluator` — full-stack fallback
- `blind-evaluator-be` — backend only (Python, pytest, schema)
- `blind-evaluator-fe` — frontend only (TypeScript, build, i18n)

### handoff.json — Debate-to-Execution Contract

When a debate skill (`/tkc` or `/tk`) concludes that implementation is needed, it writes a structured handoff:

```json
{
  "from_skill": "tkc",
  "debate_topic": "Redis vs in-memory LRU for session caching",
  "final_decision": "Use Redis with 5min TTL — in-memory LRU breaks under horizontal scaling",
  "target_files": ["backend/services/cache.py", "backend/config.py"],
  "acceptance_criteria": ["pytest passes", "cache hit rate ≥80% in load test"],
  "evidence_summary": "Phase 0 found 3 endpoints doing redundant DB queries...",
  "iteration_hint": "normal"
}
```

Ralph reads this on startup, pre-populates its investigation hints, then deletes it (one-shot handoff). **Ralph still runs its own full investigation** — the handoff accelerates, it doesn't bypass.

### 4-Tier Routing

| Tier | When | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| **0: Direct** | 1 gap, 1 file, mechanical | Just fix it (rare) |
| **1: Solo** | 1-2 gaps, single layer | `/tkc` or `/tk` → `/ralph` |
| **2: Multi** (default) | 2+ gaps | `/tkm` → N terminals |
| **3: Team** | Production incident | Agent Teams |

**Tier 2 is the default.** ADHD exists to distribute work. Single-terminal is the exception.

### Phase Completion Gates (v2)

Each phase outputs a structured gate checklist before the next phase can begin. Gates use fill-in templates — not prose MUSTs — because models follow output format instructions more reliably than behavioral constraints.

```
┌─ PHASE A GATE ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agents spawned: 3 (min 3)       ✅                  │
│ Findings per agent: {a1:5, a2:3, a3:4} (min 3 each)│
│ Gap count (individual items): 12                    │
│ DHR written to: .../dhr.json                        │
│ Gate status: PASS                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Gates exist for Phase A, A.5, B, C, and D. Each emits a JSONL observability event.

### Anti-Deflation

Debate skills enforce aggressive scope preservation:
- **Category A** (accept): concrete flaw with proof
- **Category B** (reject by default): scope reduction as pragmatism
- **Category C** (reject): generic risk aversion
- **Position Lock**: prevents retroactive weakening between defense and synthesis
- **≥70% scope preservation** or explain with Category A evidence

### Witness Mesh

External hook-based validation. Addresses the core problem: LLMs grading their own work is like students grading their own exams.

```
Skill runs → output produced → Stop hook fires → witness script checks completeness
  → Missing evidence? → exit 2 (forced to continue)
  → All present? → exit 0 (passes)
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Generator never judges its own work.** Blind evaluator with fresh context, Opus model, mandatory skepticism.
2. **The best Phase D is one that runs.** v1's mandatory 2+ eval rounds achieved 0% execution. v2 defaults to Quick Mode (1 round, ~3 min). Pragmatism over perfection.
3. **Debate produces artifacts, not just conclusions.** `handoff.json` carries structured evidence from debate into execution.
4. **PULL-based convergence.** ADHD doesn't trust sessions to self-report. It scans git state directly.
5. **Every skill is sovereign.** Works standalone or ADHD-routed. No vendor lock-in to the orchestrator.
6. **External validation > self-assessment.** Witness mesh hooks enforce output completeness because LLM self-grading is unreliable.
7. **All paths end at /ralph.** Even trivial changes get blind-evaluator verification. The harness is non-negotiable.
8. **Enforcement via structure, not prose.** Phase Completion Gates use fill-in templates that models follow reliably, replacing scattered MUST keywords that were ignored ~70% of the time (measured across 31 runs).
